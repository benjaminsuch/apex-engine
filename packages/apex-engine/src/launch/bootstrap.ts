/**
 * Bootstrap files contain platform-specific code that is executed before the main

 *
 * This is the ideal place for setting global variables, change/adjust platform specific
 * functionalities, setting up performance marks etc. Platform specific code that is
 * required for the main app to function properly goes here.
 *
 * This file contains code that is applied to all platforms. If you want to target a
 * specific platform, use `bootstrap-window`, `bootstrap-node` etc.
 *
 * Improtant: Code in this file will be executed before all other bootstrap files.
